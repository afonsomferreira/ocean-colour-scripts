# ocean-colour-scripts
Short ocean colour remote sensing scripts

This directory contains several scripts that may be useful for ocean colour remote sensing scientists. 
All code is run in Python.
There are two main kinds of scripts:
  - User Input scripts (scripts directioned to users running the script in the terminal. These require user input and are meant to people which do not feel comfortable
                        altering code in Python.)
  - Manual scripts (scripts where users must open the script in a IDE/text editor and alter relevant portions)
